    Create a jQuery puzzle using two images sliced into five parts. Using
    jQuery, make it so that when each image slice is clicked, it will change to
    a different picture. You may use your own pictures and crop them or you can
    just download the images provided .

    Try not to spend more than 3 hours trying to get this to work.

    Helpful Tip (Adding Custom Attribute to Any HTML Tag):
    When you do this assignment, there is a little trick used by a lot of
    developers that could also be helpful. Remember that we kept emphasizing
    that HTML should contain the information, CSS the looks and JS the behavior.
    With this light, when you look at this assignment, where should the
    information about the alternative image be stored? You could argue that it
    should be in the HTML or it should be in the JS. Most experienced developers
    would argue that this should be in the HTML. Now, when you have HTML tag,
    it has some well-known attributes that have meanings for the browser. For
    example for "<img src="cat.png" />" we are using an img HTML tag with an
    attribute called 'src'. Now, we can also add whatever attributes we want
    in any HTML. For example, consider this:

    <img src='ninja1.png' data-alt-src='cat1.png' />

     We created our own unique data-alt-src attribute with the value of
     'cat1.png'. The browser would not understand what that attribute means so
     it won't do anything but in your JavaScript code you could access these
     values by doing something like below:

    $('img').click(function() {
      console.log('data-alt-src value is', $(this).attr('data-alt-src'));
    });
    Creating custom attributes and storing helpful information in these are
    common practices among experienced developers. We want you to learn this and
    apply this principle when doing this assignment.
